# Project Setup and Execution Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following software installed:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** - Your primary IDE for running the project.
    - Download and install VS Code .

2. **Python** - Ensure Python is installed on your system, and the version is **10.x** or higher.
    - Download Python .
    - Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    python --version
    ```

    You should see a version of **Python 10.x** or above.

## Project Setup

1. **Open VS Code:**
    - Open **VS Code** on your system.
    - Open the project folder within **VS Code**. Navigate to **File > Open Folder...** and select your project directory.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Open the **terminal** in **VS Code** by selecting **Terminal > New Terminal** or using the shortcut `Ctrl + ~`.
    - Ensure you're in the project folder where the `requirements.txt` file is located.
    - Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

After successfully installing the dependencies, you can run the application using **Streamlit**:

1. In the **terminal**, run the following command:

    ```
    python -m streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. This will start the **Streamlit** server, and you'll be able to access the app via a URL (usually something like `http://localhost:8501/`). Copy and paste the provided URL into your browser to see the app running.

## Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional, if dependency issues occur)

If you face issues with installing dependencies globally, create a **virtual environment**:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    - Run the following command to create a virtual environment called `venv` in your project folder:

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    - **For Windows:**

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - **For Mac/Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Once activated, install the required dependencies inside the virtual environment:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. After setting up the environment, remember to **activate the virtual environment** each time you start working on the project.

## Important Notes

- Always make sure to **open the project folder in VS Code** before running the commands.
- Ensure you **activate the virtual environment** whenever you're working with this project.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Issues with Dependencies:**
    - If you're encountering issues while installing dependencies (e.g., incompatible packages), try updating **pip** with the following command:

    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

    Then, re-run the dependency installation command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Problems Running the App:**
    - Ensure that **VS Code** is open to the correct project folder.
    - Check that all dependencies are properly installed by running `pip list` in the terminal.
